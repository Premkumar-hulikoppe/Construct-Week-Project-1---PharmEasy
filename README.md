**PharmEasy Website Clone Project**
---

**Introduction**
--

This is my first Construct Week Project at Masai School's Full Stack Web Development Course. I am currently at the end of second unit where we need to make projects as per mastery based progression environment of _Masai School_ after learnig certain tech-tools and in second unit i have learnt HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT by using which we need to create website clones. So the motto of this project is to develop *PharmEasy* website clone, which provides an online platform to buy medicines at a good price with a variety of types and prices, also along with medicines daily life health products like protein supplements, medical testing kits, kid foods etc.

  So it was a great experience to me while building this task i have learnt so many new concepts and how to apply tech-tools whatever i had learnt in my current unit. The project covers basic front end designs up to a certain level and showcasing basic functionality like signup, signin, product viewing, adding it to cart then finally placing order by filling address details and making successful payment. I greatly thankful to my instructor *Chandrasekhar* and also instructor associate *Kamal* for guiding us which helpled me to feel confident and work upon the project and to complete within the specified time period.
